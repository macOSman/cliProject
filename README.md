# cliProject
A simple UNIX CLI


Our shell is written in C, and as a prerequisite, you will need access to a Linux system and a C compiler. Before attempting to run, make sure that you have downloaded all files:
    
    - shell.c
    - minishell.h

Next open the terminal. You can compile the program using one of the following commands:  gcc, or make. This will allow the program to properly execute. Finally, you can run the program by typing: 

```bash
./shell.c
```

You should now be greeted by a prompt window ready to receive commands!
