Our shell is written in C, and as a prerequisite, you will need access to a Linux system and a C compiler. Before attempting to run, make sure that you have downloaded all files:
•	shell.c
•	minishell.h
•	printPrompt() [functional] 
Next open the terminal. You can compile the program using one of the following commands: cc, gcc, or make. This will allow the program to properly execute. Finally, you can run the program by typing: 
./shell.c
You should now be greeted by a prompt window ready to receive commands!
